# Assembler381
Acts as an assembler for the subset of MIPS used in COS 381

## Extra syntax rules
Pretty much everything should be separated by spaces. For example: sll $0, $0, 0x0 is good but sll $0,$0, 0x0 isn't
Each instruction must be on a separate line
I type instructions are written in the form beq $0, $0, 0x0 No weird parentheses 
You'll also note the absence of a label in the branch instruction. Only j type instructions can use labels
Labels must start with an uppercase letter and instructions must be lowercase
Immediate values are hex only and are written in the form -0xf (for negative 15)

## Features to add
I'd like to make the above list as short as possible
The thing needs to output to a file or something, but I don't know what form that should take yet. Currently it simply prints it's output
